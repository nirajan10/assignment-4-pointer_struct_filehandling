# Assignment 3: Array, Strings and Functions

## Instructions

1. Write code in the corresponding `src/` file for each programming task.
2. Upload a `PDF` containing all answers with output screenshot in the docs/ folder
   - You can create a doc and convert it to PDF online.
   - Name pdf as `answer.pdf`
   - Your first line of pdf should be `Name: Firstname-Lastname`. Eg: Name: Nirajan-Thakuri
1. Do not change file names — tests depend on them.
2. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

## Questions

**Q1.** Write a C program to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array.

**Q2.** Implement a C program to reverse the elements of an array.

**Q3.** Write a C program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using a sorting algorithm of your choice (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort).

**Q4.** Implement a C program to find the second largest element in an array.

**Q5.** Write a C program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

**Q6.** Write a C program to find the length of a string without using the built-in string functions.

**Q7.** Implement a C program to reverse a string.

**Q8.** Write a C program to check if a given string is a palindrome.

**Q9.** Implement a C program to count the occurrence of a specific character in a string.

**Q10.** Write a C program to concatenate two strings without using the built-in string
functions.

**Q11.** Write a function named calculateAverage that takes an array of integers as input and returns the average of the numbers.

**Q12.** Write a function named isPalindrome that takes a string as input and returns 1 if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and 0 otherwise.

**Q13.** Write a function named findFactorial that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial.

**Q14.** Write a function named convertTemperature that takes a temperature value in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit. The function should return the converted temperature.

**Q15.** Write a function named countOccurrences that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string. 

**Q16.** Write a function named reverseArray that takes an array of integers as input and reverses the order of the elements in the array.

**Q17.** Write a function named calculatePower that takes two integers, base and exponent, as input and returns the result of raising the base to the exponent.

**Q18.** Write a function named findPrimeNumbers that takes an integer n as input and prints all prime numbers from 1 to n.

**Q19.** Write a function named calculateFactorialSeries that takes an integer n as input and prints the factorial series up to n.

**Q20.** Write a function named calculateGCD that takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Q21.** Write a recursive function named calculateFactorial that takes an integer n as input and returns its factorial.

**Q22.** Write a recursive function named calculateFibonacci that takes an integer n as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

**Q23.** Write a recursive function named calculateGCD that takes two integers a and b as input and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Q24.** Write a recursive function named calculatePower that takes two integers base and exponent as input and returns the result of raising the base to the exponent.

**Q25.** Write a recursive function named calculateSumOfDigits that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of its digits.

**Q26.** Write a recursive function named reverseString that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.

**Q27.** Write a recursive function named printTriangle that takes an integer n as input and prints a triangle of asterisks (*) with n rows.

**Q28.** Write a recursive function named calculateBinary that takes an integer n as input and returns its binary representation as a string.

**Q29.** Write a recursive function named isPalindrome that takes a string as input and returns 1 if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and 0 otherwise.

**Q30.** Write a recursive function named countOccurrences that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.
